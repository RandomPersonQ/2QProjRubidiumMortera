        Venus is the second planet in the solar system, and similar to Mercury, is a rocky one. It's size is similar to our home planet but it is way, way hotter than Earths. It also has a very thick atmosphere, to the point where even if it has greater distance from the Sun than Mercury, it is hotter because its greenhouse effect is so extreme and disallows more than 90% of heat from escaping.</p>

        <p>Venus' revolutions and rotations are strange. It takes nearly 224 days to revolve around the sun but 243 days to rotate around itself -- this happens because of its super slow rotation time. Venus's spin is also slowing down and can become tidally locked in the future. But even if this is the case, Venus will still be hot throughout itself because of its very dense atmosphere.</p>
            
        <p>Venus is also one of the brightest celestial objects in outer space visible to mankind, just next to our moon. It has been rumored that this planet was named Venus by its discoverers because of this feature and its similarity to the Roman goddess Venus.

        <p>In terms of missions and spacecraft, alot of machines have made it into Venus' orbit, but only some have done the challenge to land this living furnace. One of them is the Venera 1, and it's only task was to measure the temperature of Venus before it lost contact with our communication lines.</p>

       According to astronomers, Venus is a possible candidate for terraforming. By lowering its atmospheric pressure and creating sun shields around it, it is possible to create water and harbor human life on the place.</p></div>
