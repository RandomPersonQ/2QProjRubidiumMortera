        The universe is a large, vast place. From a subatomic particle as small as a proton to massive nebulas containing billions and trillions of stars spanning light years, the universe -- being governed by the laws of physics -- is composed of many things that have different properties and reactions that make it up. Given this, it is a challenge to keep up with the events that transpire outside our safety bubble which is the Earth, but with the different discoveries and inventions of science and technology, we our fortunate enough to look and observe above our limits.</p>

        <p>However, for a civilization like ours, we can only keep track of so much, so we chose to focus on what's around us -- what are the planets around us, the bright light that moves from east to west every twenty-four hours, does the system our planet is in spin around a much larger gravitational force, and so much more. Scientists call this vicinity in space the <b><i>Solar System</i></b>, which in a nutshell consists of the star that resides in the center, the planets that orbit it, and the cold icy borders that act as the membrane of the solar system. It resides in the Milky Way Galaxy, has existed for approximately 4.5 billion years, and is halfway near its death -- which to human perspective, is a very, very long time. </p>
            
        <p>In this project, we will mainly discuss the sun and how it governs the entire solar system using its humongous mass and attractive gravity, Mercury and why it is less hotter than Venus, Venuses toxic atmospheres and funky timezones, Earth's uniqueness and the Fermi Paradox, Mars' special properties and why billionaires are going super crazy about it. We would not talk about the gas giants, the asteroid belt, and the Oort Cloud for now, because these topics will be reserved for another website. </p>
        </div>

    <div class = "paragraph2"><p>
        We will also talk about the important forces and energies keeping us in the planet alive that come from the system, and how they interact with each other to form the right balance for life to form. </p></div>
