        The planet mercury is the first planet in the solar system, as well as the first rocky planets among the four.</p>

        <p>
        Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of 4,879.4 kilometers. It is only slightly larger than the Earth's moon and is the closest planet to the sun. Despite this, Mercury is still less hotter than its twin planet Venus -- we will expand on this on the next website.</p>

        <p>Days in Mercury are very long, taking one-seventh of an Earth year or fifty-eight days on Earth. However, years in this heavenly body go by quicker than Earths because of its distance from the sun, only taking around eighty-eight Earth days. Imagine being able to celebrate a New Year every one and a half days...</p>
            
        <p>This planet has very cold and hot temperatures, ranging from freezing -170 degrees Celsius to scorching temperatures of 449 degrees Celsius. This planet quickly changes conditions because of its lack of atmosphere and the lack of ability to retain heat.</p>

        <p>Multiple spacecrafts have landed on Mercury's terrain. The first one was Mariner 10 led by NASA which imaged around 40 to 50% of the surface due to it being tidally locked with one side of the planet. The MESSENGER spacecraft was also sent to examine Mercury through fly-bys and was successful in studying and analyzing the planet.
