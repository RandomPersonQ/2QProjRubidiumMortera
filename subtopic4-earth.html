        As we all know it, we live on a planet called Earth. It isn't that small as Mercury or as big as Jupiter but it sure is special because of one thing -- it harbors life. This specialty is not to be underestimated because according to our present data and instruments, it is the only planet to do so among hundreds and thousands of light years and is exceptionally rare in the universe.</p>

        <p>The Earth has a circumference of around 40,075 km and has a gravity of 9.8 m/s^2. It resides in the habitable zone of its star, the <a href="subtopic1-sun.html">Sun</a> and is titled around 23.5 degrees on its on axis. It revolves around the Sun in 365.25 days, which when supplemented by the tilted axis of the planet causes seasons and climates on the temperate parts of the world.</p>
            
        <p>Earth's lifespan began around 4.5 billion years ago when contents of the Sun's protoplanetary disk attracted each other through the forces of gravity and formed four different rocky planets that we know of today. Earth was not as habitable as we know it, beginning from common volcanic activity and tectonic plate movement to the different continents and geological phenomena today.</p>

        <p>Through evolution and natural selection, singular-celled organisms who lived on methane became different species such as plants and animals. With photosynthesis, the process in which oxygen is exhaled by plants in exchange for carbon dioxide, our atmosphere slowly filled with helpful gases and improved life conditions on earth. If phenomena like the Milankovitch Period (Ice Age), supercontinental breakup, asteroid impacts, or even the first mutual relationship of two cells did not happen, life could have been much more advanced, or much more less intelligent than it is today.

       Earth has a moon which scientists theorize formed from the remnants of an impact of another rogue planet/ asteroid to earth and since then slowly formed the entire mass of the moon. This moon is nearly as large as Mercury, and is tidally locked to our globe.</p></div>
