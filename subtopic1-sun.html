        The sun is a G2 star and is a red giant as of 2nd of November 2021. It is the main star of the Solar System and is a very important part on keeping us alive.</p>

        <p>
        The <i>sun</i> is the center of the solar system in many ways. In the earth, it gives us the light required for plants and producers to perform photosynthesis, which provides us healthy food and agriculture; it also gives us the heat that is helpful in warming our bodies and controlling the temperature of our planet. In the solar system, the sun has more purposes and uses. One of them is by setting all the materials that are light enough to succumb to gravity in an elliptical orbit, where we go around the sun and go with it in its own quest to go around the Milky Way.</p>

        <p>Let's talk more about <i>orbits</i>. Orbits allow different parts of the earth to experience various seasons every quarter of a year because of Earth's tilted axis. Additionally, the orbit of most planets, Earth included, in the solar system is elliptical which means that in certain parts of a year, days and nights can be much longer and shorter due to the Earth being nearer or farther from the sun. Orbits also allow different space phenomena to happen such as the Halley's comet only coming every seventy-six years due to its farthest distance from the sun reaching the outskirts of the Oort Cloud.</p>
            
        <p>The sun itself also experiences <i>different events</i>, such as sunspots and very rarely energy bursts which rendered some communication and radio lines dysfunctional in the 1900s. The sun also produces a lot of UV radiation which fortunately we are protected from in the earth due to the ozone layer. Did you know that a minute of exposure from the UV radiation from the sun can be lethal? </p>
