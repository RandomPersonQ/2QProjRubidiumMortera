Sir, there are multiple CSS stylesheets because of the difference in padding for the picture layouts po.

Also Sir, Main Sheet w/ INFO is Solar System (1st clickable box in bottom from left)

and Secondary Sheet w/ INFO is Sun (2nd clickable box in bottom from left)

BONUS: Secondary Sheet V2 w/o INFO is Asteroid Belt (5th clickable box in bottom from left)

Thank you po, Sir!
